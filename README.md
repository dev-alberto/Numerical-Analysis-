# Numerical-Analysis-

### Installation
`pip install -r requirements.txt` to get started  
To run the app, run `make.bat` if you're on Windows, `make` otherwise (equivalent to `python app.py` ?).

### TODO:
+ relative reference introduced in subprojects, they work standalone and integrated in app.py
  + change `/` -> `/precision` for example is not `localhost:5000/precision`, but `localhost:5000/tema1/precision`
  + same for files loaded from txt
  + patched - modules loaded in subprojects are now loaded relative
+ make an index for `front.py` (or make an `SPA` with ng1)
+ `reference.md` - rewrite for future use
